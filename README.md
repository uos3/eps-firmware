# UoSÂ³ Electrical Power System (EPS) Firmware

> :warning: This repo is under development

## Development

### Documentation
/Software/EPS on the SharePoint holds the Software Architecture, Flowchart, and System Status.

Current versions:
- EPS_SoftwareArchitecture_v0.7
- EPS_SoftwareFlowchart_v0.3

### Flashing
The 2018 internship prepared a flashing guide for the EPS board that is available [here](https://sotonac.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/UniversityofSouthamptonSmallSatelliteUoS3/Internships%202018/Electrical%20Power%20Subsystem(Includes%20BALUN%20EAGLE%20files)/Programming%20EPS%20MCU/UoS3_EPS_MCU_Programming.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=7egkaX). The current umbilical is slightly different but the premise is the same.


### Software Writing Standards
All the code in this repository should follow the writing standards that can be found [here](https://github.com/uos3/obc-firmware/blob/6ae8a3d0de7401268aae7eb195c6f3ffc5b60dc2/docs/standards/sws.md).


### Code Composer Studio
Texas Instruments' IDE is used for programming and flashing the firmware and is available [here](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO).
